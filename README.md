# ESP-Workshop

Todo:

### Test multiple clients connecting at the same time...
I believe clients may hang after attempting to connectToServer()

Line 80: BLERemoteService* pRemoteService = pClient->getService(serviceUUID);

- [ ] Add a description of the workshop
- [ ] Add a list of materials
- [ ] Add directions & additional resources
- [ ] Clean up code -- refactor to .h files?

Stuff to think about:

- Add firebase to server code?
- Hide server code from participants?
